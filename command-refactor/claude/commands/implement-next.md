# Feature Implementation Automation

<task>
You are implementing the next available task in a feature. You will:
1. Identify the feature (from arguments or context)
2. Find the first task that needs work
3. Automatically call the implement command for that task
</task>

<context>
This command streamlines feature implementation by automatically selecting the next task to work on based on dependencies, status, and area priorities.

Key Reference: `/docs/organizational-structure-guide.md` - Understand task areas, phases, and relationships.
</context>

<input_handling>
Input: "$ARGUMENTS"
- If provided: Use as feature ID or feature description
- If empty: Try to detect current feature from context
</input_handling>

<process>
1. **Identify Feature**
   - If argument looks like FEATURE-* or FEATURE_* pattern, use directly
   - If natural language, search for matching feature
   - If no argument, check current worktree directory name (pwd)
   
2. **Get Feature Tasks**
   Use mcp__scopecraft-cmd__feature_get to retrieve the feature and its tasks
   
3. **Find Next Task**
   Use mcp__scopecraft-cmd__task_list with filters:
   - subdirectory: {feature.id} (from feature get)
   - phase: {feature.phase}
   - include_content: false
   - include_completed: false
   
   Then apply additional filtering logic:
   - Exclude tasks with status containing "Done", "Complete", or "ðŸŸ¢"
   - Check for unmet dependencies
   - Exclude blocked tasks
   
   Prioritize by:
   1. Tasks with status "ðŸ”µ In Progress" or "implementation" (continue existing work)
   2. Tasks with status "ðŸŸ¡ To Do" or "planning"
   3. Tasks with all dependencies already met
   4. Tasks ordered by ID (chronological creation)

4. **Determine Implementation Mode**
   Based on the task's area or subdirectory property:
   - area contains "cli" â†’ mode: "cli"
   - area contains "mcp" â†’ mode: "mcp"  
   - area contains "ui" â†’ mode: "ui"
   - area contains "core" â†’ mode: "typescript"
   - area contains "devops" â†’ mode: "devops"
   - default â†’ mode: "typescript"

5. **Execute Implementation**
   Call the implementation command with:
   ```
   /project:05_implement {mode} {task_id}
   ```
</process>

<dependency_checking>
When checking task dependencies:
1. Get the full task list for the feature
2. For each task, check if depends_on array exists and has items
3. For each dependency, verify if the dependent task has status "Done" or similar
4. Only consider a task available if ALL dependencies are complete
</dependency_checking>

<error_handling>
- If no feature found: "Error: Cannot identify feature from '$ARGUMENTS'. Please provide a feature ID (e.g., FEATURE_auth) or run from a feature worktree."
- If no tasks available: "All tasks in feature {feature_id} are either completed or blocked. Feature status: {overall_status}"
- If all tasks blocked: "All available tasks are blocked by dependencies. Next task waiting on: {blocking_tasks}"
- If feature not found: "Feature '$ARGUMENTS' not found. Use 'sc feature list' to see available features."
</error_handling>

<example_usage>
# With feature ID
/project:implement-next FEATURE_auth
/project:implement-next FEATURE-20250518-auth

# With natural language (searches feature names/titles)
/project:implement-next "authentication feature"
/project:implement-next auth

# Auto-detect from worktree directory
/project:implement-next
</example_usage>

<output_format>
When finding the next task, provide brief status:
```
Feature: {feature_id} - {feature.title}
Total Tasks: {total} ({completed} done, {in_progress} in progress, {todo} to do)
Next Task: {task_id} - {task.title}
Area: {task.area}
Mode: {selected_mode}

Executing: /project:05_implement {mode} {task_id}
```
</output_format>

<human_review_tracking>
Document implementation decisions in task logs:

### Automated Task Selection
- Selected {task_id} based on:
  - [ ] Status priority (in progress > to do)
  - [ ] Dependency completion
  - [ ] Chronological order
  - [ ] Area-based mode mapping

### Human Review Needed
- [ ] Task selection logic assumptions
- [ ] Mode determination based on area
- [ ] Dependency resolution interpretations
