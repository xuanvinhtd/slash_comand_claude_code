# Feature Planning Template

## Problem Statement
{What specific problem are we solving? Why is it important?}

## User Story
As a {type of user}, I want {goal} so that {benefit}.

## Proposed Solution
{High-level description of the feature. How will it work from the user's perspective?}

## Goals
- {Specific measurable objective}
- {Another objective}
- {Keep goals SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound}

## Non-Goals
- {What this feature will NOT do}
- {Explicit scope limitations}

## Technical Breakdown

### Area: UI
- [ ] Task: {Specific UI component/change}
- [ ] Task: {Another UI task}

### Area: Core
- [ ] Task: {Core logic implementation}
- [ ] Task: {Data model changes if needed}

### Area: MCP
- [ ] Task: {MCP tool integration if applicable}

### Area: CLI
- [ ] Task: {CLI command modifications if needed}

### Area: Docs
- [ ] Task: Update documentation for new feature
- [ ] Task: Add examples and usage guide

## Dependencies
- {Other features or tasks that must complete first}
- {External dependencies or services}

## Risks & Open Questions
- [ ] {Potential technical challenge}
- [ ] {Unresolved design question}
- [ ] {Performance or scalability concern}

## Success Criteria
- [ ] {How we'll know the feature is complete}
- [ ] {Acceptance criteria from user perspective}
- [ ] {Performance or quality metrics if applicable}

## Implementation Notes
{Any additional context, design decisions, or technical considerations}

## Human Review Required

Planning decisions to verify:
- [ ] Complexity assessment (simple vs feature-worthy)
- [ ] Area designation via tags vs folders
- [ ] Task granularity for AI session scope
- [ ] Sequential dependencies identified correctly
- [ ] Original PRD properly linked/referenced
- [ ] Feature folder organization appropriate
- [ ] Correct phase assignment
- [ ] Task breakdown completeness

Technical assumptions:
- [ ] Architecture decisions implicit in task breakdown
- [ ] Integration approach assumptions
- [ ] Performance/scaling considerations
- [ ] Security implementation needs
