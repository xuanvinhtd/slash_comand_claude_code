# Document Editor Prototype Analysis & Comparison to Scopecraft Vision

## Executive Summary

The document-editor prototype demonstrates a sophisticated markdown editing interface with AI-powered features. While it excels in certain areas that align with Scopecraft's vision, there are significant architectural differences that need to be addressed for integration into the V2 task management system.

## Document Editor Prototype Features

### Core Capabilities
1. **Section-Based Editing**
   - Automatically parses markdown into editable sections by headers
   - Each section operates as an independent editing unit
   - Sections can be edited individually with inline editing
   - Empty sections are automatically removed

2. **Dual-Mode Interface**
   - Seamless toggle between view and edit modes
   - Hover-activated action panels
   - Keyboard shortcuts (E to edit, Shift+Enter to save)
   - Visual feedback with border highlighting

3. **AI-Powered Actions**
   - **Tone Adjustment**: Change writing tone (concise, formal, funny, etc.)
   - **Content Improvement**: AI-assisted content enhancement with custom instructions
   - **Diagram Generation**: Convert text to visual diagrams
   - **Knowledge Extraction**: Extract entities for knowledge graph

4. **Layout Architecture**
   - Resizable panels (document, sources, AI assistant, questions)
   - Collapsible panels for focused work
   - Command palette (Cmd+K) for quick actions
   - Relationship tree visualization

5. **User Experience**
   - Hover states reveal action buttons
   - Processing states with loading indicators
   - Popover configurations for AI actions
   - Modern UI with shadcn/ui components

## Alignment with Scopecraft Vision

### ✅ Strong Alignments

1. **Section-Based Documents**
   - Prototype's section parsing aligns perfectly with Scopecraft's unified document model
   - Both support independent section editing
   - Natural fit for Instruction/Tasks/Deliverable/Log structure

2. **AI-First Design**
   - AI actions built into the editing experience
   - Command palette for AI operations
   - Knowledge extraction features align with entity linking vision

3. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with simple markdown, add AI features as needed
   - Non-intrusive UI that appears on demand
   - Follows "guide, don't cage" philosophy

4. **Modern UI Patterns**
   - Clean, focused interface
   - Keyboard-driven workflows
   - Responsive panel system

### ⚠️ Gaps & Misalignments

1. **Visual Design Language**
   - Prototype uses light theme, Scopecraft requires dark terminal aesthetic
   - Missing monospace font (JetBrains Mono)
   - Lacks grid background pattern and terminal-inspired styling

2. **Task-Specific Features Missing**
   - No metadata fields (type, status, priority, tags)
   - No workflow state management
   - No schema-driven form generation
   - Missing task-specific validation

3. **Architecture Differences**
   - Prototype focuses on document editing, not task management
   - No integration with MCP APIs
   - Missing parent/subtask creation flows
   - No consideration for task relationships

4. **Content Structure**
   - Free-form sections vs required task sections
   - No enforcement of required fields
   - Missing task-specific templates

## Product Manager Recommendations

### 1. Adopt & Adapt Core Patterns

**What to Keep:**
- Section-based editing architecture
- Inline editing with hover actions
- AI action integration pattern
- Resizable panel layout concept

**What to Modify:**
- Apply Scopecraft dark theme and typography
- Add task metadata editing above content
- Integrate with MCP task_create/update APIs
- Add validation for required sections

### 2. Hybrid Approach for V2

I recommend a **hybrid modal + inline editing** approach:

#### Task Creation (Modal)
- Quick creation with minimal fields
- Progressive disclosure of advanced options
- Template selection for task types
- Option to expand to full editor

#### Task Editing (Inline + Panel)
- Inline metadata editing at top
- Section-based content editing below
- Right panel for AI assistance
- Preserve the hover-to-reveal actions

### 3. Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Core Integration**
- Adapt DualUseMarkdown for task sections
- Add metadata form component
- Apply Scopecraft styling
- Basic MCP integration

**Phase 2: Enhanced Features**
- AI actions for task-specific operations
- Template-based creation
- Parent task flows
- Relationship management

**Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities**
- Knowledge extraction to entity links
- Cross-task AI operations
- Workflow automation
- Advanced validation

### 4. Key Technical Decisions

1. **State Management**: The prototype's local state approach works but consider:
   - Zustand for form state
   - React Query for MCP operations
   - Optimistic updates for better UX

2. **Validation Strategy**:
   - Zod schemas from metadata architecture
   - Progressive validation (warn but don't block)
   - Schema-driven form generation

3. **AI Integration**:
   - Keep the action pattern but integrate with real AI
   - Add task-specific prompts
   - Consider streaming responses

## Conclusion

The document-editor prototype provides an excellent foundation for the V2 create/edit UI. Its section-based editing and AI integration patterns align well with Scopecraft's vision. However, significant adaptation is needed to:

1. Match the visual design language
2. Add task-specific features and metadata
3. Integrate with the MCP architecture
4. Support the full task lifecycle

The recommended hybrid approach leverages the best of both worlds: quick modal creation for simple tasks and rich inline editing for detailed work. This maintains the "guide, don't cage" philosophy while providing powerful tools for both humans and AI agents.

## Next Steps

1. Update research task to analyze specific patterns from document-editor
2. Design mockups that blend document-editor UX with Scopecraft requirements
3. Create proof-of-concept adapting DualUseMarkdown for task sections
4. Define AI action library for task-specific operations
